![](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.5-green.svg) &nbsp; ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/author-archine-green.svg)  
With the rise of springboot and springcloud, rapid development is becoming more and more popular,    
so I wrote this project, which is mainly used to improve the development speed,    
including a variety of common tool classes,      
so as to eliminate the need to write a project to encapsulate the waste of time.     
      
Our primary goals are:   
* Speed up development;   
* Provides common tools for project development without having to re-encapsulate every time you write a project;   
* Simple and practical;
